# DT Business Analyst Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains my submission for the DT Business Analyst assignment focused on healthcare SMB clinics.  
The objective of this assignment is to design practical, low-friction systems that reduce operational errors, improve patient communication, and minimize doctor cognitive load.

The solutions are designed keeping real-world clinic constraints in mind, such as manual workflows, time pressure, and limited staff capacity.

## Assignment Structure

### Task 1: Clinic Inventory Statistical Micro-Audit
This task focuses on identifying where inventory errors are most likely to occur in small clinics and designing lightweight, daily statistical checks to detect and reduce revenue leakage caused by manual entry errors.

### Task 2: Patient Care & Communication System Design
This task proposes a simple patient communication and follow-up system using HMS data and Google Sheets, aimed at reducing WhatsApp overload while preserving care quality and protecting doctor time.

## Approach
I approached this assignment by prioritizing:
- Realistic clinic workflows
- Low-effort, high-impact controls
- Process discipline through system design rather than enforcement
- Scalability without increasing doctor workload
