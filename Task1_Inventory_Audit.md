# Task 1: Clinic Inventory Statistical Micro-Audit

## Objective
In small healthcare clinics, inventory is usually managed manually due to limited staff and lack of barcode systems. The objective of this task is to identify where inventory errors are most likely to occur and design lightweight, daily statistical checks that help detect mistakes early and prevent revenue leakage.

The focus is not on perfect reconciliation, but on practical error detection in real clinic conditions.

## Where Inventory Errors Are Most Likely to Occur
In small clinics, inventory mismatches usually happen due to manual entry, time pressure, and multitasking. The most common risk points are:

- Sales entries during peak OPD hours when staff are rushed  
- Manual quantity entry for medicines with similar names or packaging  
- Missed entries for free samples or partial strip sales  
- Stock updates done at end of day instead of real time  
- Multiple staff members handling billing and inventory without clear ownership  

These errors are usually unintentional but accumulate over time.

## Daily Statistical Micro-Audit Checks
Instead of checking the entire inventory daily, the clinic can run simple checks on selected data points:

### 1. High-Value Item Check
Each day, randomly select 5–10 high-cost medicines and compare:
- Opening stock  
- Sales quantity  
- Closing stock  

Large deviations indicate possible entry errors.

### 2. Fast-Moving Medicine Check
Track medicines with high daily sales volume. Sudden drops or spikes in usage can signal missed or duplicate entries.

### 3. Zero-Sale Anomaly Check
If a commonly sold medicine shows zero sales on a busy day, it should be flagged for review.

### 4. Random Item Spot Check
Randomly audit a small set of medicines daily to create uncertainty and encourage careful data entry.

These checks take minimal time but significantly improve accuracy.

## How These Checks Improve Staff Compliance
When staff know that small random checks happen daily:
- Carelessness reduces naturally
- Staff enter data more attentively
- Errors are corrected early instead of accumulating
- Accountability becomes part of routine work

This improves discipline without adding pressure or blame.

## Practical Impact
This micro-audit system:
- Fits into busy clinic workflows
- Requires no new software
- Reduces inventory leakage
- Improves trust in inventory data

From an operational perspective, this approach is realistic and easy for clinics to adopt.
